# SubMerge
A Python tool for combining SRT files.

To get started using SubMerge:
1. Download the Python file and make sure you have these libraries: re, pprint and operator
2. Download the example SRT files. These are for an episode of The Walking Dead
3. Run the program and test to ensure that it merges properly
4. Turn off debug mode in the Python file

Start merging subtitles!

I've tested SubMerge on my Ubuntu 17.10 machine only. Some modifications may need to made for Windows, Mac, or another Distro.
