9
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,211
Little girl?

10
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,339
I'm a policeman.

11
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,600
Little girl.

12
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,727
Don't be afraid, okay?

13
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,394
Little girl.

14
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,081
Oh my God.

15
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,643
-What's the difference

16
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,019
between men and women?

17
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,522
- This a joke?
- No, I'm serious.

18
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,601
I never met a woman
who knew how to turn off alight.

19
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,736
They're born thinking
the switch only goes one way--

20
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,068
- on.

21
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,654
They're struck blind
the second they leave a room.

22
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,990
I mean every woman
I ever let have a key--

23
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,201
I swear to God,
it's like I come home,

24
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,083
house all lit up.

25
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,085
And my job,
you see, apparently--

26
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,747
because my chromosomes
happen to be different--

27
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,665
is I've then gotta walk
through that house,

28
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,426
turn off every single light
this chick left on.

29
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,337
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby. Mmm.

30
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,506
Oh, Reverend Shane is
preaching to you now, boy.

31
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,019
Then-- the same chick, mind you--

32
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,101
she'll bitch about global warming.

33
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,938
You see, this is- this is
when Reverend Shane wants

34
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,694
to quote from
the guy gospel and say,

35
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:57,029
"Darling, maybe you and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

36
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,364
just figure out the light switch,
you see, goes both ways,

37
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,326
maybe we wouldn't have so much
global warming." You know?

38
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,206
- You say that?
- Mmm.

39
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,289
Yeah, well, a polite version.

40
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,955
Still, man, that earns me this look

41
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,124
of loathing you would not believe.

42
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,544
And that's when
the "Exorcist" voice pops out.

43
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,634
"You sound just like my damn father!

44
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,515
Always yelling
about the power bill,

45
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,221
telling me to tum off
the damn lights!"

46
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,058
- And what do you say to that?
- I know what I want to say.

47
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,893
I want to say,
"Bitch, you mean to tell me

48
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,557
you've been hearing this
your entire life

49
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,318
and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?"

50
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,032
You know, I--
I don't actually say that though.

51
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,908
- That would be bad.
- Right right.

52
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,616
Yeah, I go with the--
I go with the polite version there too.

53
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,621
- Very wise.
- Yes sir.

54
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,578
- Mm-hmm.
- Well.

55
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,334
So how's it with Lori, man?

56
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,249
She's good- she's good
at turning off lights.

57
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,386
Really good. I'm the one
who sometimes forgets.

58
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,546
Not what I meant.

59
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,428
- We didn't have a great night.
- Hey look, man,

60
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,473
I may have failed
to amuse with my sermon,

61
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,516
but I did try.

62
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,231
The least you can
do is-- is speak.

63
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,276
That's-- that's what
she always says.

64
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,113
"Speak. Speak."

65
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,575
You'd think I was the most
closed-mouth son of a bitch ever

66
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,455
to hear her tell it.

67
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,201
Do you express your thoughts?

68
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,796
Do you share your feelings,
that kind of stuff?

69
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,088
The thing is--

70
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,713
lately, whenever I try,

71
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,179
everything I say
makes her impatient,

72
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,309
like she didn't want
to hear it after all.

73
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,304
It's like she's...

74
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,270
Pissed at me all the time
and I don't know why.

75
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,978
Look, man. That's just shit
couples go through.

76
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,317
Yeah, it's a phase.

77
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,828
The last thing
she said this morning,

78
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,742
"Sometimes I wonder
if you even care about us at all."

79
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,916
She said that
in front of our kid.

80
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,712
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

81
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,505
The difference
between men and women?

82
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,560
I would never say something
that cruel to her...

83
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,017
And certainly not
in front of Carl.

84
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,024
All available units,

85
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,529
high-speed pursuit in progress.

86
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,816
Linden County units
request local assistance.

87
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,701
Highway 18 eastbound. GTA, ADW,

88
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,704
2-17, 2-4-3.
Advise extreme caution.

89
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,719
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

90
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,176
Be advised they have fired
upon police officers.

91
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,215
One Linden County officer
is wounded.

92
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,104
Unit 1, unit 3, to eastbound Route 18,

93
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,068
two miles west of Interstate 85.

94
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,653
Will patch in
Linden County sheriff radio.

95
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,238
Roger that. We're five minutes south

96
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,654
of the Route 18 intersection.

97
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,743
Dispatch, unit 1 and unit 3,

98
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,034
we are 10-97 and code 100,

99
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,794
Highway 18,
E.B. of interstate, please advise.

100
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,752
10-9,
we just got word from Linden County

101
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,588
that they're off 18,
now southbound--

102
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,884
Old French Road
is closed down there

103
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,765
so they're gonna head
back onto 18.

104
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:58,106
Sounds like they chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we've got.

105
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,891
Maybe we'll get on one of them
video shows, you know?

106
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,981
Like "World's Craziest Police Chases."
What do you think?

107
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,941
What I think, Leon,
is you need to stay focused,

108
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,402
make sure you've got a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

109
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,374
Would be kinda cool,
getting on one of them shows.

110
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,540
Holy shit.

111
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,822
- Gun gun gun!
- Put it down!

112
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,983
Put the gun down!

113
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,658
Ah!

114
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,396
Rick!

115
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,561
I'm all right!

116
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,737
I saw you get tagged, man.

117
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,277
That scared the hell out of me.

118
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,320
Me too.

119
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,489
That son of a bitch shot me.

120
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,079
- You believe that?
- What? It catch you in your vest?

121
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,835
Yeah.

122
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,916
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened-- ever.

123
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,676
You understand? Ah!

124
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,763
- Police, move in!
- No no no no no no no.

125
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,391
- You see where he come from?
- Shh shh shh shh.

126
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,426
No no no no
no no no no.

127
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,936
He's hit!

128
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,814
Leon! You get
that ambulance down here!

129
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,941
You tell them there's
an officer down! You do it now!

130
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,443
Okay, shh shh shh shh.

131
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,944
I'm here. Hey, you look at me.
You stay with me.

132
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,026
You hear me?
Shh shh shh. Okay.

133
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,861
I'm right here, Rick.
Stay with me. You hear me?

134
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,367
Shh shh. That's it. Do you hear me?
Shh shh shh. Okay.

135
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,620
I'm right here with you.
Stay with me.

136
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,655
- Shh shh. That's it. I'm right here.

137
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,620
Dispatch, we have an officer down.

138
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,409
Request paramedics,
please respond.

139
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,418
Route 18 two miles west of I-85.

140
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,705
Repeat, officer down.
Request immediate response.

141
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,805
Hey, bud.

142
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,600
We're still here.

143
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,307
We're still hanging in.

144
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,475
I'm sorry, man.

145
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,144
I know I say the same crap
every time I come in here.

146
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,113
Everybody pitched in on these.

147
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,528
They-- they wanted me
to bring 'em down.

148
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,412
They send their love,
and they just--

149
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,994
they hope you come back real soon.

150
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,208
Linda and Diane from dispatch,

151
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,713
they picked these out.

152
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,045
Probably could tell, huh?

153
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,088
I'm just gonna set these
on your side table, okay?

154
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,517
That vase-
that's something special.

155
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,187
'Fess up. You steal that for me
at Grandma Jean's house?

156
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,986
I hope you left her
that spoon collection.

157
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,913
Shane?

158
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,881
Shane, you in the john?

159
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,711
Nurse, help.

160
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,208
Nurse, help.

161
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,313
Ah!

162
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,002
Ah.

163
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,137
Ah.

164
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,896
Ah. Ah. Oh shit.

165
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,686
Lori.

166
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,232
Lori!

167
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,405
Carl. Carl!

168
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,530
Shoot

169
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,784
Lori! Carl!

170
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,635
Lori! Carl.

171
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,616
Is this real?

172
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,780
Am I here?

173
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,921
Wake-- wake up.

174
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,657
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Carl.

175
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,952
Carl. I found you.

176
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,837
Daddy, I got the sumbitch!
I'm gonna smack him dead!

177
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,389
He say something?
I thought I heard him say something.

178
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,925
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

179
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,936
Hey, mister,
what's that bandage for?

180
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,769
W-- what?

181
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,104
What kind of wound?

182
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,110
You answer me, damn you.

183
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,237
What's your wound?

184
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:48,945
You tell me...

185
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,327
Or I will kill you.

186
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,136
You got
that bandage changed now.

187
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,849
It was pretty rank.

188
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:22,232
What was the wound?

189
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,770
- Gunshot.
- Gunshot?

190
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,735
What else? Anything?

191
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,571
Gunshot ain't enough?

192
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,241
Look, I ask and you answer.

193
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,907
That's common courtesy, right?

194
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,581
Did you get bit?

195
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,004
- Bit?
- Bit, chewed,

196
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,011
maybe scratched--
anything like that?

197
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,172
No, I got shot.

198
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,642
Just shot as far as I know.

199
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,519
Hey. Just let me.

200
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,061
Feels cool enough.

201
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,026
Fever would've killed you by now.

202
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,317
I don't think I have one.

203
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,325
Be hard to miss.

204
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:23,078
Take a moment,
look how sharp it is.

205
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,587
You try anything,

206
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,214
I will kill you with it.

207
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,591
And don't you think I won't.

208
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,892
Come on out when you're able.

209
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,730
Come on.

210
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,766
This place--
Fred and Cindy Drake's?

211
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,896
Never met 'em.

212
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,729
I've been here.
This is their place.

213
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,269
It was empty when we got here.

214
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,484
Don't do that.
They'll see the light.

215
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,119
There's more of them
out there than usual.

216
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:43,033
I never should've fired
that gun today.

217
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,826
Sound draws them.
Now they're all over the street.

218
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,623
Stupid-- using a gun.

219
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,583
But it all happened so fast,

220
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,296
I didn't think.

221
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,461
You shot that man today.

222
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,051
- Man?
- It weren't no man.

223
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,966
What the hell was that
out of your mouth just now?

224
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,352
It wasn't a man.

225
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,138
You shot him in the street
out front- a man.

226
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,149
Friend, you need glasses.
It was a walker.

227
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:12,187
Come on. Sit down

228
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,605
before you fall down.

229
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,899
Here.

230
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,703
Daddy,

231
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,535
blessing.

232
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,825
Yeah.

233
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,177
Lord, we thank Thee for this food,

234
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,388
Thy blessings.

235
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,645
And we ask You to watch over us
in these crazy days.

236
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,225
-Amen.
- Amen.

237
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,281
Hey, mister, you even know
what's going on?

238
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:01,615
I woke up today in the hospital,

239
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,531
came home
and that's all I know.

240
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,578
But you know about
the dead people, right?

241
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,042
Yeah, I saw a lot of that--

242
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,708
out on the loading dock,
piled in trucks.

243
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,377
No, not the ones they put down.

244
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,921
The ones they didn't--
the walkers,

245
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,887
like the one I shot today.

246
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,596
'Cause he'd have ripped into you,

247
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,228
tried to eat you,
taken some flesh at least.

248
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,732
Well, I guess if this is
the first you're hearing it,

249
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,564
I know how it must sound.

250
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,189
They're out there now?
In the street?

251
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,448
Yeah.

252
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,201
They get more active
after dark sometimes.

253
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,203
Maybe it's the cool air or--

254
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:48,286
hell, maybe it's just
me firing that gun today.

255
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,497
But we'll be fine
as long as we stay quiet.

256
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,958
Probably wander off by morning.

257
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,583
But listen,

258
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,927
one thing I do know--

259
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,009
don't you get bit.

260
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,175
I saw your bandage
and that's what we were afraid of.

261
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,810
Bites kill you.

262
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,767
The fever burns you out.

263
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,647
But then after a while...

264
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,143
You come back.

265
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,568
Seen it happen.

266
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,824
Come on.

267
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:41,795
Carl-- he your son?

268
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:46,181
Well, you--
you said his name today.

269
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,176
He's a little younger

270
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,140
than your boy.

271
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:52,930
And he's with his mother?

272
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,517
I hope so.

273
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,276
Dad.

274
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,313
Hey.

275
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,198
Did you ask him?

276
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,277
Your gunshot--

277
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,071
we've got a little bet going.

278
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,161
My boy says
you're a bank robber.

279
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,416
Yeah, that's me,

280
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,672
the deadliest Dillinger. Kapow.

281
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,175
-- Sheriff's deputy.

282
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,011
Uh-huh.

283
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,050
Hey, it's okay. Daddy's here.

284
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,969
It's nothing.

285
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,014
One of them must've
bumped a car.

286
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,184
- Are you sure?
- It happened once before.

287
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,354
It went on for a few minutes.

288
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,027
Get the light, Duane.

289
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,126
it's the blue one on the street,

290
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,257
the same one as last time.

291
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,544
I think we're okay.

292
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:11,763
That noise--
won't it bring more of them?

293
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,724
Nothing we can do about it now.

294
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,184
Just have to
wait 'em out till morning.

295
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,603
She's here.

296
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,148
Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

297
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,909
I said go. Go on.

298
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:37,122
- Duane. Duane, quiet now.

299
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,252
Come on. Quiet now.

300
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,915
Shh shh.

301
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,856
It's okay. Here.

302
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,613
Cry into the pillow.
Do you remember?

303
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,899
Shh. Shh.

304
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,151
She, um--

305
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,900
she died in that other room

306
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,694
on that bed in there.

307
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,956
There was nothing I--
I could do about it.

308
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,413
That fever, man,

309
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,126
her skin gave off
a heat like a furnace.

310
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,837
I should've--

311
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,347
I should've put her down, man.
I should've put her down.

312
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,053
I know that, but I--

313
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,013
you know what?
I just didn't have it in me.

314
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,819
She's the mother of my child.

315
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,714
Are we sure they're dead?

316
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,759
I have to ask
at least one more time.

317
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,768
They dead,

318
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,895
except for something in the brain.

319
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,227
That's why
it's got to be the head.

320
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,754
Y'all all right?

321
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,754
I need a moment.

322
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,061
They're alive--
my wife and son.

323
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,062
At least they were
when they left.

324
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,598
How can you know?

325
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,608
By the look of this place--

326
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,270
I found empty drawers
in the bedroom.

327
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,779
They packed some clothes-- not a lot,

328
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,939
but enough to travel.

329
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,280
You know anybody could've broken in
here and stole them clothes, right?

330
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,946
You see the framed photos
on the walls?

331
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,577
Neither do I.

332
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,617
Some random thief take
those too, you think?

333
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:13,341
Our photo albums,
family pictures" all gone.

334
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:18,426
Photo albums.

335
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,683
My wife-- same thing.

336
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,893
There I am
packing survival gear,

337
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,479
she's grabbing photo alb...

338
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,448
They're in Atlanta, I bet.

339
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,780
That's right.

340
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,492
- Why there?
- Refugee center.

341
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,624
A huge one they said,
before the broadcast stopped.

342
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:49,002
Military protection, food, shelter.

343
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,037
They told people to go there,

344
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,797
said it'd be safest.

345
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,958
Plus they got that disease place.

346
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,922
The Center
for Disease Control

347
00:38:57,085 --> 00:39:00,055
said they were working out
how to solve this thing.

348
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,826
Gas lines have been down
for maybe a month.

349
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,542
The station's got
its own propane system.

350
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,716
Pilot's still on.

351
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,338
- Whoo-hoo!
- Oh my Lord.

352
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,552
- Hot water!
- Ah!

353
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,592
That feels good, right?

354
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,135
-- Bring it around, bring it

355
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,929
Bring it, bring it,
bring it around, uh!

356
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,723
Yeah. I'm wet.
Take that. What?

357
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,312
Whoo!

358
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,939
Duane.
Dressing room back there.

359
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,071
What do you say, Duane?

360
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,985
Thank you.

361
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,412
Mm-hmm.

362
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,955
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

363
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,379
Safer anyway-- people.

364
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,585
That's where we were headed.

365
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,750
Things got crazy.

366
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,885
Man, you wouldn't
believe the panic.

367
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,921
Streets weren't Ht to be on.

368
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,680
And then my--

369
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,593
my wife couldn't travel--

370
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,434
no, not with her hurt--
so we had to find a place to lay low.

371
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,019
And then after she died,

372
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,188
we just stayed hunkered down.

373
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,483
I guess we just froze in place.

374
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,286
Plan to move on?

375
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,871
Haven't worked up to it yet.

376
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,843
A lot of it's gone missing.

377
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,384
Daddy, can I learn
to shoot?

378
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,140
- I'm old enough.
- Hell yes, you're gonna learn,

379
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,677
but we've got to do it carefully,
teach you to respect the weapon.

380
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,845
That's right. it's not a toy.

381
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,639
You pull the trigger,
you have to mean it.

382
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,308
Always remember that, Duane.

383
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,646
Yes sir.

384
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,482
Here. Load up.

385
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,114
You take that one.
Nothing fancy.

386
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,282
The scope's accurate.

387
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,930
Conserve your ammo.

388
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,716
It goes faster than you think,

389
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,634
especially at target practice.

390
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,934
- Duane.
- Uh-huh?

391
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,689
- Take this to the car.
- Okay.

392
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,850
Are you sure
you won't come along?

393
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,154
A few more days.
By then Duane will know how to shoot

394
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,985
and I won't be so rusty.

395
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,032
You've got one battery.

396
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,542
I'll turn mine on a few minutes
every day at dawn.

397
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,999
You get up there,
that's how you'll find me.

398
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,336
- You think ahead.
- Can't afford not to,

399
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,001
- not anymore.
- Listen, one thing--

400
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,887
they may not seem
like much one at a time,

401
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,969
but in a group,
all riled up and hungry--

402
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:33,055
- man, you watch your ass.
- You too.

403
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,849
You're a good man, Rick.
I hope you find your wife and son.

404
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,235
Be seeing you, Duane.

405
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,442
- Take care of your old man.
- Yes sir.

406
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,914
Leon Basset?

407
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,249
I didn't think much of him--

408
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,759
careless and dumb-- but...

409
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,838
I can't leave him like this.

410
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,600
You know they'll hear the shot.

411
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,103
Let's not be here
when they show up.

412
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,730
Let's go, son. Come on.

413
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,359
Read your comic books awhile.

414
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,243
Daddy'll be upstairs.

415
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,447
- Daddy?
- it's all right, Duane!

416
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,533
You stay there, son.
Don't you come up here.

417
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,607
Jenny.

418
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,693
Come on, baby.

419
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,556
I'm sorry this happened to you.

420
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,192
Come on. Come on.

421
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,498
Come on.

422
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,159
Yeah.

423
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,621

Anybody out there?

Anybody hears me,
please respond.

430

Hello, can you hear my voice?

431

Hello. Hello.
Can anybody hear my voice?

432
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,818
- Hey. Hello?
- Can you hear my voice?

433
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,860
Yes, I can hear you.
You're coming through. Over.

If anybody reads, please respond.

438
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,718
We're just outside the city.

439
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,719
- Damn it.

440
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,348
Hello? Hello?
He couldn't hear me.

441
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:52,929
- I couldn't warn him.
- Try to raise him again.

442
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:56,062
Come on, son, you know best
how to work this thing.

443
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,316
Hello, hello. ls the person
who called still on the air?

444
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,696
This is Officer Shane Walsh

445
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,403
broadcasting to person unknown.
Please respond.

446
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,574
He's gone.

447
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,336
There are others.
it's not just us.

448
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,962
We knew there would be, right?

449
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,464
That's why we left the CB on.

450
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,124
A lot of good it's been doing.

451
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,009
- Okay.
- And I've been saying for a week

452
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:30,171
we ought to put signs up on 85
and warn people away from the city.

453
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,305
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

454
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,558
Well, we haven't had time.

455
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,928
I think we need to make time.

456
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,850
Yeah, that--
that's a luxury we can't afford.

457
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,439
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

458
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:47,605
And who the hell would
you propose we send?

459
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,444
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

460
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,609
Nobody goes anywhere alone.
You know that.

461
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,661
Yes sir.

462
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,542
Hey hey hey.
Go on, take a seat, bud.

463
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,544
You're all right.
Go on. You're all right.

464
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,674
What, are you pissed at me?

465
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,972
You can be pissed at me all you want.
it's not gonna change anything.

466
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,805
I'm not putting you
in danger, okay?

467
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,594
I'm not doing it for anything.

468
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,638
That make you feel like
sometimes you want

469
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,681
to slap me upside the head--
tell you what, girl:

470
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:26,022
you feel that need, you go right ahead.
I'm right here. Go on.

471
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,822
You cannot walk off like that,

472
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,904
all half-cocked.

473
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,071
Look, you do not want to do it
for my sake or your sake, that's fine.

474
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:39,365
But just-- you do it for him.

475
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,080
That boy has been
through too much

476
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,041
and he's not losing
his mother too, okay?

477
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,665
Okay?

478
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,674
I'm a good mom.

479
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,009
You tell me "okay."

480
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,930
Hmm?

481
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,848
it's not hard.

482
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,564
All right? Hey.

483
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,367
Mom?

484
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,464
What's up, bud?
She's in there. Go on.

485
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,961
Hey, I don't want you to worry.

486
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,551
Your mama's not
going anywhere, okay?

487
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:39,183
Yeah? Yeah?

488
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,309
- Go finish your chores. Okay.
- Okay.

489
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,430
Hello?

490
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,268
Police officer out here.

491
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,230
Can I borrow some gas?

492
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,452
Hello?

493
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:51,126
Hello?

494
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,541
Anybody home?

495
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,899
- Easy now. Easy.

496
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,408
I'm not gonna hurt you.

497
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,911
Nothing like that.

498
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,744
More like a proposal.

499
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,826
Atlanta's just down
the road a ways.

500
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:56,543
It's safe there--
food, shelter, people.

501
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,799
Other horses too, I bet.

502
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,927
How's that sound?

503
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,259
There we go. Good boy.

504
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,392
Good boy. Good boy.

505
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,803
Now come with me. Come on.

506
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,846
Come on. Come on.

507
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:14,435
Come on.

508
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:17,609
Good boy.

509
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,941
Just go easy, okay?

510
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,656
I haven't done this for years.

511
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,618
- Whoa. Whoa whoa whoa!

512
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,034
Easy now.

513
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,794
Easy, boy.
Easy. Easy.

514
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:39,298
Easy. Easy. Eas--
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

515
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:41,629
Whoa whoa whoa.

516
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,473
Let's go.

517
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,578
- Whoa.

518
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,419
- Steady.

519
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,176
There's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

520
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,805
Okay. Whoa whoa whoa.

521
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,062
Whoa.

522
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,609
- Hyah!

523
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:31,195
Oh shit.

524
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,697
Oh God.

525
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:51,667
Oh God. Oh God.

526
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,266
Shoot

527
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,029
Oh God. Oh God.

528
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,763
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

529
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,939
Oh... God.

530
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:15,417
Ah.

531
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:19,379
Ah.

532
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,472
Oh God.

533
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,946
Hey, you.

534
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:11,408
Dumbass.

535
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,248
Yeah, you in the tank.

536
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:17,039
Are you cozy in there?

537
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:19,549
- I Yeah I

538
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,883
Drifting on the spaceway

539
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,052
By the Betelgeuse Hotel

540
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:33,893
Mapping out constellations

541
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,729
Of the place I know so well

542
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,110
Sifting through the system

543
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:41,772
For the piece
that knows my name

544
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,191
Endlessly I listen

545
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,859
In the master game

546
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,198
Welcome to my world

547
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,035
Welcome
to my world

548
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,871
Welcome to my only world

549
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,956
Welcome to
my only world

550
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:00,625
It is full of space junk

551
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,293
But your words
are coming through

552
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:10,596
I'm riding on the spacejunk

553
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,511
And it's bringing me to you

554
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,317
Riding on the space junk

555
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:23,692
And it's bringing me to you

556
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:29,194
Bringing me to you

557
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,744
Yeah!

558
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:39,421
It's bringing me to you

559
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,172
Girl, yeah

560
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,834
Oh!

561
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:48,964
It's bringing me to you

562
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:53,969
It's bringing me to you

563
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,516
It's bringing me to you.
